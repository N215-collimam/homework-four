## This is an example of trying to change a website to be responsive to the media it is being shown in.


Our objectives for this particular webpage were to:

Teach you how to make your site responsive

Use media queries

Use percentages

Start focusing on mobile

I made changes to the webpage's code that I set up in the last assignment were I took a lot of the widths and heights I had set to a concrete number and changed them to be a min and max width or a percentage. I also set up media queries for the aspects of the website that needed to stack and chnage as the webpage got smaller for mobile views.
